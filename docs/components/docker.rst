Docker
======

OSMNames is built with `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ and is therefore shipped in containers. This allows to have an extra layer of abstraction and avoids overhead of a real virtual machine. Specifically, it is built with Docker compose thus allowing to define a multi-container architecture defined in a single file.
