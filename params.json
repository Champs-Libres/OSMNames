First line has column names.\r\n- Different type of records are stored in different files (download and index just what you need, sometimes you don't need POIs or addresses with house numbers)\r\n- Possible to generate from a country specific extract of Open Street Map (together with vector tiles)\r\n\r\n### Why to make this\r\n\r\n- Direct indexing via fulltext search engines (SphinxSearch, ElasticSearch, etc.)\r\n- Simple process to get a **basic** search in place names on a map within minutes\r\n- Downloading the basic gazeteer data from OSM in usable format is problematic now (a need to process large OSM Planet files)\r\n\r\n### Sample search server\r\n\r\n- Powered by super fast open-source fulltext Sphinxsearch - inspired by Swiss GeoAdmin search service\r\n- JSON/JSONP API similar to Nominatim: nominatim.openstreetmap.org\r\n- Ready to use via Docker in minutes\r\n- https://github.com/klokantech/osmnames-sphinxsearch\r\n- osmnames.klokantech.com/\r\n\r\n### Data format of tsv export of OSMNames\r\n\r\n```\r\nname \t\t\t\tthe name of the feature (default language is en, others available(de,es,fr,ru,zh))\r\nclass\t\t\t\t\r\ntype\r\nlon\r\nlat\r\nplace_rank\t\t\trank from 1-30 ascending depending on the type and class\r\nimportance\t\t\timportance [0.0-1.0] depending on wikipedia if available otherwise just the ranking\r\nstreet \t\t\t\t\r\ncity\r\ncounty\r\nstate\t\r\ncountry\t\r\ncountry_code\t\tISO-3166 2-letter country code\r\ndisplay_name\t\tthe display name representing the hierarchy\r\nwest\t\t\t\tbbox\r\nsouth\t\t\t\tbbox\r\neast\t\t\t\tbbox\r\nnorth\t\t\t\tbbox\r\nwikipedia \t\t\tthe wikipedia URL associated with this feature\r\n\r\n```",
